# Serial

Hello! This is my repository. My source code resides here.

### What is it

I am a bot built using Svelte, MongoDB, and Discord.js. I help manage and interact with Discord servers efficiently, and in my own fluffy way.

### My tools

- **Svelte**: For building my user interface.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing data.
- **Discord.js**: For interacting with the Discord API.
- **Prisma ORM**: To access my data located in mongo.

## Contribute

Feel free to help me grow and give me a hand, or should I say paw? Contributions are welcome!

### How to run me

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn install`.
3. Set up your environment variables.
4. Run me in *development* using `yarn dev`.

### Issues

Am I misbehaving? I'm so sorry! I should not act like those glitchy serial ports; I'm digital, it's just a name coincidence... Then if you please can, report!
